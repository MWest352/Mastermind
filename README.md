### Mastermind ###

# This is a game involving two sub games based on a "secret code" of colored pegs.
# In Code Breaker, the computer chooses the code and you must guess it correctly.
# In Code Maker, You set the code and the computer attempts to guess your code through logic and reasoning.  
# After each guess, the Code Maker must tell the code breaker if the color is correct.  
# This may be in the form of Correct Color Wrong Placement, or Correct Color, Correct Placement.  
# Each color may only be used once. There are four spots, but six colors.
# Players get 12 attempts to guess.  
# Choose Wisely and Good Luck.
